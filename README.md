# Architects of the digital realm
Here's the open source version of my Custom GPT-based text+image adventure game, Architects of the Digital Realm.

The game is what happens when Dungeons and Dragons, Monkey Island, and Office Space have a baby.

This Custom GPT is based on the great work of @levelsio (see: https://github.com/levelsio) and their work on The Secret of Monkey Island: Amsterdam.
