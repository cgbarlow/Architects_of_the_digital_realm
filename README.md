# Architects of the digital realm
Here's the open source version of my ChatGPT game Architects of the Digital Realm.

It's a funny image+text-based adventure game based on Monkey Island-style gameplay. The game is inspired by Magic: The Gathering and Dungeons & Dragons, and takes place in a contemporary modern office setting.

This Custom GPT is based on the great work of @levelsio (see: https://github.com/levelsio) and their work on The Secret of Monkey Island: Amsterdam.
